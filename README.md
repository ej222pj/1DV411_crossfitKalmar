* On Github we have a master branch and a dev branch
* The master branch is the same as production or contains deployment ready code
* The dev branch is ahead of master and contains all new code currently being worked on
* Locally we both work on the dev branch and push to github when something is ready
* The other dev fetches any new changes from the dev branch before pushing his new code
* When dev branch is good,we merge with the master branch
* Locally we have several feature branches issue branches etc.
